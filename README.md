## Problem 1: Sass

- I previously wrote my css codes in a .scss file because I followed the installation process in the bootstrap docs and it is included there to use a .scss file. When deploying to Github Pages it does not read the scss file. I tried bunch of solutions but in the end I gave up and just used a regular css file.

## Problem 2: Bootstrap Default Styling

- I am having a hard time overwriting the default style in Bootstrap. Sometimes, when a certain code doesn't work, I don't know if it is a problem with my code or it just can't overwrite the style. My simple solution is `!important`.
